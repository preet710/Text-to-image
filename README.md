# Text-to-image
A Text-to-Image Generator that converts textual descriptions into corresponding images using AI.
Overview
This project demonstrates how to use a state-of-the-art text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion, to convert text descriptions into visual art. Whether you're exploring AI-generated art or building a creative tool, this project offers a straightforward example of how to harness diffusion models.
Features
Text-to-Image Conversion: Generate images directly from text prompts.
Stable Diffusion Integration: Utilizes the well-known Stable Diffusion model for image generation.
Customizable Parameters: Easy to modify parameters such as prompt text, device usage (GPU/CPU), and output file paths.
Modular Code: Basic, clean code structure that you can expand or integrate into other applications.
Optional UI: While the current version is script-based, it can be integrated into a graphical user interface if needed.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3 
Diffusers library
Transformers
PyTorch (with GPU support recommended for faster generation)
Additional libraries: Accelerate, PIL (Python Imaging Library)
Installation
Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/text-to-image.git
cd text-to-image
pip install diffusers transformers accelerate torch
In the code, you can change the text prompt, adjust the output path, or modify model parameters to better suit your needs.

How It Works
Model Loading: The project loads the Stable Diffusion model using the Diffusers library, automatically detecting and utilizing GPU if available.
Prompt Processing: A text prompt is passed to the model, which processes it to generate a corresponding image.
Output Generation: The resulting image is saved locally, making it easy to share or further process the generated art.
